I learned how to use turtlesim(a ros2 package good for learning) it was quite simple actually 
1st i had to 1st install it using 
sudo apt update ros2
sudo apt ros2-humble-turtlesim

--this is for seeing list:-
ros2 pkg list

--to see exectutabe files--
ros2 pkg executables

--specific executables for turtlesim
 ros2 pkg executables turtlesim

--ok to launch it use 
ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node

--run this :- to control your turtle
ros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_key

then i learned that ros workes in nodes so here is something about nodes:-
for help:-
ros2 node-h

for list :-
ros2 node list

it will show you your current nodes(running):
input--/# ros2 node list
output-- /teleop_turtle
/turtlesim
