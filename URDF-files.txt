downlode them:-
apt update
apt install -y ros-humble-urdf-tutorial



Option 1: Clone ros2 branch (most likely the one compatible with Humble)
bash
Copy
Edit
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/ros/urdf_tutorial.git -b ros2
Option 2: Clone default branch and check available branches
bash
Copy
Edit
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/ros/urdf_tutorial.git
cd urdf_tutorial
git branch -a
This will list available branches like:

bash

remotes/origin/ros2
remotes/origin/foxy-devel
remotes/origin/noetic-devel
