URDF files are ways to tell discription of our robot.
URDF stands for unfied robotics discription format it is a .xml file

to run the tutorial files you should run this:=-
downlode them:-
apt update
apt install -y ros-humble-urdf-tutorial



Option 1: Clone ros2 branch (most likely the one compatible with Humble)
bash
Copy
Edit
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/ros/urdf_tutorial.git -b ros2
Option 2: Clone default branch and check available branches
bash
Copy
Edit
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/ros/urdf_tutorial.git
cd urdf_tutorial
git branch -a
This will list available branches like:

bash
Copy
Edit
remotes/origin/ros2
remotes/origin/foxy-devel
remotes/origin/noetic-devel
For ROS 2 Humble, the ros2 or foxy-devel branch is generally compatible.

Additional Tip
After cloning:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build
source install/setup.bash


üîß 1. Confirm Build
If you haven't already built the workspace:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
üìÅ 2. Explore the package
Let's list the contents of the tutorial:

bash
Copy
Edit
ls src/urdf_tutorial
You‚Äôll find example URDF files under urdf/ and possibly launch files under launch/.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è 3. Run the First URDF Example
Assuming you're using Gazebo and RViz, try launching the first example:

bash
Copy
Edit
ros2 launch urdf_tutorial display.launch.py model:=urdf/01-myfirst.urdf
If that doesn‚Äôt work, try this instead (as some versions place the URDF under urdf/01-myfirst.urdf.xacro):

bash
Copy
Edit
ros2 launch urdf_tutorial display.launch.py model:=urdf/01-myfirst.urdf.xacro
üß™ 4. What this does
This command runs RViz to visualize a basic URDF robot.

The model:=... part tells the launch file which URDF to load.
